	<h2>The Head Start Process</h2>
	<p>Welcome to Head Start, in order to complete the registration process the Federal Government requires families to submit a number of documents regarding both the child
		and household. If a specific document, such as foster child documentation, does not apply please ignore the document. If you are unsure if a document applies please
		check our FAQ page for more information.</p>
	<p> The registration and completion process has three steps and this page will be updated as the status of the child changes.</p>
	<p>1. New Applicant : A new applicant is one who has just begun the registration process.</p>
	<p>2. Waitlisted Applicant : Once all required documents are submitted a child will be placed into a waitlist in which they shall remain until a spot opens in the program.</p>
	<p>3. Enrolled : Once a spot opens and the child is officially enrolled they can begin attending the program(?). Please note to complete enrollment an orientation meeting must be scheduled
		with a representative at an OC Head Start office. For more information on orientation please view out FAQ page or contact the OC Head Start office closest to you by using our
		locator service. -insert link-</p>
